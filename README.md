Carkasjak's Simple Speed Filter - A loot filter designed for a faster and more efficient Path of Exile endgame.

This filter is heavily inspired by NeverSink and some sections are borrowed from it, but it is stricter and more minimalistic than even NeverSink's Uber-Strict

Installation: Download the file carcass.filter and put it in your %USERPROFILE%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile/ folder.

For leveling and mapping early on in a league I recommend using NeverSink's Regular filter instead:
